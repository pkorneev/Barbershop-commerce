# Barbershop business web

This is an almost ready-to-use web application for a barbershop to run your business. The only thing to change is to connect it to the CMS(replace hardcoded object with services with a data witch you would GET from the CMS, replace reservation form with CMS data to track reservations and conditionally show oportunities).
